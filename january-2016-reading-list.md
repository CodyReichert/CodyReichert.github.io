title: January 2016 Reading List
---

One of my goals this year is to spend more time reading. Books on
business, startups, psychology, history, etc, are all fair game.

Last month, January, I picked up a few new books. Some I really like
and others were OK. In no particular order:

# Completed

## [Rework - Jason Fried](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745)

Reading *Rework* was a breath of fresh air. Brilliantly put together,
blunt no-fluff advice, and wittingly accurate illustrations and
metaphors made this my #1 book this month.

If you're new to startups, veteran to startups, interested in the
culture, or anywhere in between, then go to your local Amazon and pick
this up immediately. You won't regret it.


## [Zero to One - Peter Thiel](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455737377&sr=1-1&keywords=zero+to+one)
Zero to One is filled with interesting insight from one of our
startup culture's very own, Peter Thiel. There's no denying that
Thiel is a smart businessman - so that alone is reason enough to
read anything he writes.

This book really made me think about some tough topics like
competing with your competition and how major technilogical
advances occur. Every chapter of this book got me pumped up to
build something world-changing.


## [The Virgin Way - Richard Branson](http://www.amazon.com/Virgin-Way-Its-Worth-Doing/dp/1591847982/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455737278&sr=1-1&keywords=the+virgin+way)
I didn't have many expectations going into this book - but I came
out with nothing but praise for Sir Branson and The Virgin Way. The
book is funny, thought-provoking, and riddled with real life
anecdotes about Virgin and other mega-corps (Netflix, Microsoft,
etc).

I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Richard
Branson, or what it's like running hundreds of businesses. His
writing is easy to read and intriguing, it's hard to put down!

After this one, I'll be looking to pick up a couple more of Richard
Bransons books.


## [How to Win Friends and Influence Peopl - Dale Carnegie](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455737210&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+win+friends)
A classic. Anyone who has read any of Dale Carnegie's books (then
you've probably read this one) would tell you that is writing style
is one of a kind and hilariously interstesting. How to Win Friends
is a must read (and re-read) for anyone in a leadership role.

I'll keep this one on the shelf and read it again.


# In Progress

## [Lincoln the Unknown - Dale Carnegie](http://www.amazon.com/Lincoln-Dale-Carnegie/dp/160796550X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455737421&sr=1-1&keywords=lincoln+the+unknown)
I picked Up Lincoln the Unknown after finishing Carnegie's other
book, How to Win Friends. Lincoln the Unknown is an interesting
tale of Abraham Lincoln's life and upbringing.

I haven't quite finished it, so let's hope for an update next month.


## [The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455737458&sr=1-1&keywords=the+hard+thing+about+hard+things)
At this point in time, the most I've read of this book is the
inside cover. Horowitz's book is highly recommened across the
industry as a guide for managing a startup.
