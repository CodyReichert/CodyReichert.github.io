## :wave: About me

Hey there, I'm Cody Reichert. This is my club.

I build [assertible.com](https://asertible.com),
[simplyrets.com](https://simplyrets.com),
[identibyte](https://identibyte.com), and other things.

My main interests are software development, interaction design, and
iterating and planning on early stage products to refine and assess
product market fit. **JavaScript**, **Haskell**, and **Common Lisp**
are my programming languages of choice, and it probably goes without
saying that **Emacs** is my favorite tool for the job.

If you have any questions or comments on one of my businesses or
products, feel free to [reach out or connect](#find-me-around) to stay
updated.
