title: "Chrome Canary: Take mobile device screenshots"
---

I came across a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/ChromeDevTools/status/738864794497753088)
the other day by [@ChromeDevTool](https://twitter.com/ChromeDevTools)
that I had to share - super cool.

In the latest
[Chrome Canary build](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html)
you can not only view your website on different mobile device sizes,
but you can now also view the device and take a screenshot of the
whole thing! Here's an example:

<div style="max-width:100%;text-align:center">
![*fig 1.2*](/images/chrome-canary-screenshot.png)
</div>
<br/>
<i>So meta</i>

I'll leave you to play with all the different devices and take your
own screenshots - go download the latest Chrome Canary build and get
started!
